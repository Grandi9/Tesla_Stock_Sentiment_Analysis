# Tesla_Stock_Sentiment_Analysis
Created a stock sentiment predictor based on the tweets on Tesla, and compared it to the Yahoo Finance data.


## Problem:

* Aim to predict the future stock price of TESLA based on historical stock price data and implement sentiment analysis of that data.

* Collected data from two different sources - Twitter and Yahoo finance. We did the sentimental analysis using the Kaggle dataset and used the previous stock price data from Yahoo finance to predict the future stock price.

* Data from Twitter - Sentiment has 16 features (1.1GB) (Used scrapped data from Tweepy bot from a Kaggle dataset)

* Data form Yahoo  - Previous stock price has 7 features (50 KB)
